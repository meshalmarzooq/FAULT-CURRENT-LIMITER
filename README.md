# FAULT-CURRENT-LIMITER
In this project I was mainly focus on the fault current limiter. The protection schemes associated with the existing distribution systems face challenges in the form of integration of distributed generators (DGs) including renewable energy sources (RES). One of the main challenges is the increase in the fault current level to a level higher than the breaking capacity of existing breakers and fuses. This demand resetting of relays, circuit breakers and related protective devices with every new integration of RES. This problem can be addressed with the application of fault current limiter (FCL). The FCL should be adaptive in nature so that the system is protected even with variations in the share of RES. The working and effectiveness of the adaptive FCL is demonstrated on a radial distribution test system. The simulations are performed in Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS). I have attached a small report that describe the FLC design and its control circuit. Also, it shows the simulation results with/without DG.
